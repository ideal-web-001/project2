                MS-DOS stands for Microsoft disk operating system. It is a single operating system. For IBM and IBM
                compatible personal. <mark>It was introduced in 1981 jointly Microsoft and IBM and was the most popular
                    operating system for personal computer.</mark> In the 1980s because of its popularity, Microsoft
                took a
                decision to
                launch independently windows O.S
                In 1990s.<br><br>
                Dos is a single user O.S for personal computer in 1980s. The two more wide used versions of dos where
                PC-DOS
                &MS-DOS developed by Microsoft corporation. The function of these two versions were same. The basic
                differences were the type of computer on which they were installed. Microsoft developed PC-DOS for IBM
                which
                is turn installed & sold MS-DOS to maker of IBM compatible.
                When the first developed DOS, it used a command line interface latter Version included both command line
                &
                menu driven user interface as well as improve memory and disk management millions computer running, Dos
                no
                longer very much because it doesn't offer a graphical user interface (GUI) and it can support modern 32bits

        MS-DOS is the O.S recommended for PCs. The program in the O.S allows us to communicate with the computer
        and
        its peripheral devices and latest take advantage of those resources. It also helps us manage memory.
        MS-DOS also helps to manage programs and data. Once MS-DOS has been loaded into the computer memory, it
        will
        allow us to use application software such as word-processor, spread -sheet, and power -Point software
        etc.
        Thus, disk O.S is very essential for a computer function. For loading the O.S three essential file must
        be
        present <br><br>
        1. MS-DOS.sys <br>
        2. IO.sys <br>
        3. Command. sys <br><br>

        loading of these files into memory is called booting up.
